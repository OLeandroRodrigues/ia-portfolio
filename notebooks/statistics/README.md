## 📊 Statistics
This folder contains a collection of statistical modeling experiments. Each notebook or script is dedicated to simulating scenarios, building statistical models, and evaluating the feasibility of different hypotheses or use cases.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this directory is to:

Build and analyze statistical models using real or synthetic data
Simulate "what if" scenarios to explore possible outcomes
Test the viability of assumptions before applying models in real-world or academic contexts
Document insights, failures, and improvements in the modeling process

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
You will find use of:
Probability distributions
Hypothesis testing
Regression models (linear, logistic, etc.)
Bayesian modeling
Monte Carlo simulations
Exploratory data analysis
