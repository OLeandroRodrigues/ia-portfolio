# AI Portfolio

Welcome to my AI Portfolio!  
This repository gathers a collection of hands-on projects, experiments, and learning notebooks focused on core concepts and applications of Artificial Intelligence.

As an aspiring AI Engineer, I'm building this portfolio to:

- Solidify my understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and optimization.
- Implement both foundational models and state-of-the-art techniques.
- Solve real-world problems using AI, from classical regression to neural networks and transformers.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- 📊 Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- 📚 Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs)
- 🧠 Gradient Descent and Backpropagation
- 🧮 Linear Algebra and Calculus for AI
- 🧾 NLP and Transformers
- 👁️ Computer Vision
- 📈 Model Evaluation and Explainability (XAI)

## 🚀 Tools & Frameworks

- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
- TensorFlow / Keras & PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Feel free to explore the folders, open the notebooks, and track my progress as I grow into an AI engineer!
